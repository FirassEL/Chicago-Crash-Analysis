# Chicago Vehicle Crash Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing vehicle crash data from the city of Chicago using R. The datasets used in this project include information on vehicles involved in crashes, passenger details, and crash event data. The goal is to explore the data through visualizations, identify trends in crash patterns, and perform data wrangling to prepare the datasets for further analysis.

## Datasets Used
The project uses three key datasets:

1. Vehicles Dataset:
- Contains details about vehicles involved in crashes, including vehicle make, model, type, and associated crash data.

2.Passengers Dataset: 
- Includes passenger and driver details, such as age, gender, and injuries sustained in crashes.

3. Crash Dataset:
- Contains information about the crash events themselves, including the time, location, severity, and contributing factors.

## Objectives 
The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into vehicle crash trends in Chicago, such as:

The most common types of crashes
The impact of weather and time on crash frequency
Crash severity analysis
The relationship between vehicle type and crash outcomes
This project does not involve statistical modeling or predictive analytics but focuses on exploring the data, performing data wrangling, and creating meaningful visualizations to represent the findings.

## Key Tasks
1. Data Wrangling:
- Cleaning and merging the three datasets into a unified format for analysis.
- Handling missing or inconsistent data, such as filling or removing null values.
- Formatting and transforming data to make it easier to work with.

3. Data Exploration:
- Investigating the relationships between various factors, such as the number of accidents by vehicle type, severity, weather conditions, or time of day.
- Identifying patterns and trends in the crash data.
  
4. Data Visualization:
- Creating charts and plots to better understand the data and highlight important trends. This includes:
- Crash frequency by time of day, day of the week, and month.
- Vehicle type and crash severity distribution.
- Geographic analysis of crash locations.
- Injury severity analysis by vehicle type and passenger demographics.

5. Crash Pattern Analysis:
- Analyzing specific patterns in crash types (e.g., rear-end collisions, side-impact crashes).
- Examining how environmental factors (weather, road conditions) influence crash rates and severity.

## Key Visualizations
The project contains several visualizations, including but not limited to:

- Crash Frequency by Days, Months and Years: bars plot and city maps showing the number of crashes at different time of the year.
- Crash Severity Distribution: Including the primary contributory factors that lead to crash, and the severities accumulated throughout these crashes 
- Vehicle Type vs. Crash Severity: Several plots showing the distribution of crash severity across different vehicle types.
- Crash Locations on a Map: A map visualizing crash hotspots in the city.
- Weather Impact on Crash Frequency: A heatmap showing the correlation between weather conditions and the number of crashes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data wrangling and visualization techniques can provide valuable insights into vehicle crashes and help identify trends that may inform public policy, safety measures, and city planning. Although no statistical models are used, the visualizations and patterns uncovered in this analysis can serve as a foundation for further research or predictive modeling.
